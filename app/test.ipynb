       "{'Foundations': 'C HAPTE R 1 cases, the information is owned by someone who isn’t willing to share them. In other cases, the information has been lost or destroyed. Traditionally, reverse engineering has been about taking shrink-wrapped products and physically dissecting them to uncover the secrets of their design. Such secrets were then typically used to make similar or better products. In many industries, reverse engineering involves examining the product under a microscope or taking it apart and figuring out what each piece does. Not too long ago, reverse engineering was actually a fairly popular hobby, practiced by a large number of people (even if it wasn’t referred to as reverse engineering). Remember how in the early days of modern electronics, many people were so amazed by modern appliances such as the radio and television set that it became common practice to take them apart and see what goes on inside? That was reverse engineering. Of course, advances in the electronics industry have made this practice far less relevant. Modern digital electronics are so miniaturized that nowadays you really wouldn’t be able to see much of the interesting stuff by just opening the box. Software Reverse Engineering: Reversing Software is one of the most complex and intriguing technologies around us nowadays, and software reverse engineering is about opening up a program’s “box,” and looking inside. Of course, we won’t need any screwdrivers on this journey. Just like software engineering, software reverse engineering is a purely virtual process, involving only a CPU, and the human mind. Software reverse engineering requires a combination of skills and a thorough understanding of computers and software development, but like most worthwhile subjects, the only real prerequisite is a strong curiosity and desire to learn. Software reverse engineering integrates several arts: code breaking, puzzle solving, programming, and logical analysis. The process is used by a variety of different people for a variety of different purposes, many of which will be discussed throughout this book. Reversing Applications So what are the common applications of reverse engineering in the software world? Generally speaking, there are two categories of reverse engineering applications: security-related and software development–related. The following sections present the various reversing applications in both categories. Security-Related Reversing For some people the connection between security and reversing might not be immediately clear. Reversing is related to several different aspects of computer security. For example, reversing has been employed in encryption research—a researcher reverses an encryption product and evaluates the level of security it provides. Reversing is also heavily used in connection with malicious software, on both ends of the fence: it is used by both malware developers and those developing the antidotes. Finally, reversing is very popular with crackers who use it to analyze and eventually defeat various copy protection schemes. All of these applications are discussed in the sections that follow. Malicious Software serves as an introduction to the world of malicious software and demonstrates how reversing is used by antivirus program writers. Chapter 7 demonstrates how software vulnerabilities can be located using reversing techniques. Reversing Cryptographic Algorithms Cryptography has always been based on secrecy: Alice sends a message to Bob, and encrypts that message using a secret that is (hopefully) only known to her and Bob. Cryptographic algorithms can be roughly divided into two groups: restricted algorithms and key-based algorithms. Restricted algorithms are the kind some kids play with; writing a letter to a friend with each letter shifted several letters up or down. The secret in restricted algorithms is the algorithm itself. Once the algorithm is exposed, it is no longer secure. Restricted algorithms provide very poor security because reversing makes it very difficult to maintain the secrecy of the algorithm. Once reversers get their hands on the encrypting or decrypting program, it is only a matter of time before the algorithm is exposed. Because the algorithm is the secret, reversing can be seen as a way to break the algorithm. On the other hand, in key-based algorithms, the secret is a key, some numeric value that is used by the algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the message. In key-based algorithms users encrypt messages using keys that are kept private. The algorithms are usually made public, and the keys are kept private (and sometimes divulged to the legitimate recipient, depending on the algorithm). This almost makes reversing pointless because the algorithm is already known. In order to decipher a message encrypted with a key-based cipher, you would have to either: ■■ Obtain the key ■■ Try all possible combinations until you get to the key ■■ Look for a flaw in the algorithm that can be employed to extract the key or the original message Still, there are cases where it makes sense to reverse engineer private implementations of key-based ciphers. Even when the encryption algorithm is wellknown, specific implementation details can often have an unexpected impact on the overall level of security offered by a program. Encryption algorithms are delicate, and minor implementation errors can sometimes completely invalidate the level of security offered by such algorithms. The only way to really know for sure whether a security product that implements an encryption algorithm is truly secure is to either go through its source code (assuming it is available), or to reverse it. Digital Rights Management Modern computers have turned most types of copyrighted materials into digital information. Music, films, and even books, which were once only available on physical analog mediums, are now available digitally. This trend is a mixed blessing, providing huge benefits to consumers, and huge complications to copyright owners and content providers. For consumers, it means that materials have increased in quality, and become easily accessible and simple to manage. For providers, it has enabled the distribution of high-quality content at low cost, but more importantly, it has made controlling the flow of such content an impossible mission. Digital information is incredibly fluid. It is very easy to move around and can be very easily duplicated. This fluidity means that once the copyrighted materials reach the hands of consumers, they can be moved and duplicated so easily that piracy almost becomes common practice. Traditionally, software companies have dealt with piracy by embedding copy protection technologies into their software. These are additional pieces of software embedded on top of the vendor’s software product that attempt to prevent or restrict users from copying the program. In recent years, as digital media became a reality, media content providers have developed or acquired technologies that control the distribution of content such as music, movies, etc. These technologies are collectively called digital rights management (DRM) technologies. DRM technologies are conceptually very similar to traditional software copy protection technologies discussed above. The difference is that with software, the thing which is being protected is active or “intelligent,” and can decide whether to make itself available or not. Digital media is a passive element that is usually played or read by another program, making it more difficult to control or restrict usage. Throughout this book I will use the term DRM to describe both types of technologies and specifically refer to media or software DRM technologies where relevant. This topic is highly related to reverse engineering because crackers routinely use reverse-engineering techniques while attempting to defeat DRM technologies. The reason for this is that to defeat a DRM technology one must understand how it works. By using reversing techniques a cracker can learn the inner secrets of the technology and discover the simplest possible modification that could be made to the program in order to disable the protection. I will be discussing the subject of DRM technologies and how they relate to reversing in more depth in Part III. Auditing Program Binaries much safer to run software that has often been inspected and approved by thousands of impartial software engineers. Needless to say, open-source software also provides some real, tangible quality benefits. With open-source software, having open access to the program’s source code means that certain vulnerabilities and security holes can be discovered very early on, often before malicious programs can take advantage of them. With proprietary software for which source code is unavailable, reversing becomes a viable (yet admittedly limited) alternative for searching for security vulnerabilities. Of course, reverse engineering cannot make proprietary software nearly as accessible and readable as open-source software, but strong reversing skills enable one to view code and assess the various security risks it poses. I will be demonstrating this kind of reverse engineering in Chapter 7. Reversing in Software Development Reversing can be incredibly useful to software developers. For instance, software developers can employ reversing techniques to discover how to interoperate with undocumented or partially documented software. In other cases, reversing can be used to determine the quality of third-party code, such as a code library or even an operating system. Finally, it is sometimes possible to use reversing techniques for extracting valuable information from a competitor’s product for the purpose of improving your own technologies. The applications of reversing in software development are discussed in the following sections. Achieving Interoperability with Proprietary Software Interoperability is where most software engineers can benefit from reversing almost daily. When working with a proprietary software library or operating system API, documentation is almost always insufficient. Regardless of how much trouble the library vendor has taken to ensure that all possible cases are covered in the documentation, users almost always find themselves scratching their heads with unanswered questions. Most developers will either be persistent and keep trying to somehow get things to work, or contact the vendor for answers. On the other hand, those with reversing skills will often find it remarkably easy to deal with such situations. Using reversing it is possible to resolve many of these problems in very little time and with a relatively small effort. Chapters 5 and 6 demonstrate several different applications for reversing in the context of achieving interoperability. Developing Competing Software most products, and so reversing an entire software product in order to create a competing product just doesn’t make any sense. It is usually much easier to design and develop a product from scratch, or simply license the more complex components from a third party rather than develop them in-house. In the software industry, even if a competitor has an unpatented technology (and I’ll get into patent/trade-secret issues later in this chapter), it would never make sense to reverse engineer their entire product. It is almost always easier to independently develop your own software. The exception is highly complex or unique designs/algorithms that are very difficult or costly to develop. In such cases, most of the application would still have to be developed independently, but highly complex or unusual components might be reversed and reimplemented in the new product. The legal aspects of this type of reverse engineering are discussed in the legal section later in this chapter. Evaluating Software Quality and Robustness Just as it is possible to audit a program binary to evaluate its security and vulnerability, it is also possible to try and sample a program binary in order to get an estimate of the general quality of the coding practices used in the program. The need is very similar: open-source software is an open book that allows its users to evaluate its quality before committing to it. Software vendors that don’t publish their software’s source code are essentially asking their customers to “just trust them.” It’s like buying a used car where you just can’t pop up the hood. You have no idea what you are really buying. The need for having source-code access to key software products such as operating systems has been made clear by large corporations; several years ago Microsoft announced that large customers purchasing over 1,000 seats may obtain access to the Windows source code for evaluation purposes. Those who lack the purchasing power to convince a major corporation to grant them access to the product’s source code must either take the company’s word that the product is well built, or resort to reversing. Again, reversing would never reveal as much about the product’s code quality and overall reliability as taking a look at the source code, but it can be highly informative. There are no special techniques required here. As soon as you are comfortable enough with reversing that you can fairly quickly go over binary code, you can use that ability to try and evaluate its quality. This book provides everything you need to do that. systems, and low-level programming languages such as assembly language. It is the layer that isolates software developers and application programs from the physical hardware. The development tools isolate software developers from processor architectures and assembly languages, while operating systems isolate software developers from specific hardware devices and simplify the interaction with the end user by managing the display, the mouse, the keyboard, and so on. Years ago, programmers always had to work at this low level because it was the only possible way to write software—the low-level infrastructure just didn’t exist. Nowadays, modern operating systems and development tools aim at isolating us from the details of the low-level world. This greatly simplifies the process of software development, but comes at the cost of reduced power and control over the system. In order to become an accomplished reverse engineer, you must develop a solid understanding of low-level software and low-level programming. That’s because the low-level aspects of a program are often the only thing you have to work with as a reverser—high-level details are almost always eliminated before a software program is shipped to customers. Mastering low-level software and the various software-engineering concepts is just as important as mastering the actual reversing techniques if one is to become an accomplished reverser. A key concept about reversing that will become painfully clear later in this book is that reversing tools such as disassemblers or decompilers never actually provide the answers—they merely present the information. Eventually, it is always up to the reverser to extract anything meaningful from that information. In order to successfully extract information during a reversing session, reversers must understand the various aspects of low-level software. So, what exactly is low-level software? Computers and software are built layers upon layers. At the bottom layer, there are millions of microscopic transistors pulsating at incomprehensible speeds. At the top layer, there are some elegant looking graphics, a keyboard, and a mouse—the user experience. Most software developers use high-level languages that take easily understandable commands and execute them. For instance, commands that create a window, load a Web page, or display a picture are incredibly high-level, meaning that they translate to thousands or even millions of commands in the lower layers. Reversing requires a solid understanding of these lower layers. Reversers must literally be aware of anything that comes between the program source code and the CPU. The following sections introduce those aspects of low-level software that are mandatory for successful reversing. Assembly Language language is the language of reversing. To master the world of reversing, one must develop a solid understanding of the chosen platform’s assembly language. Which bring us to the most basic point to remember about assembly language: it is a class of languages, not one language. Every computer platform has its own assembly language that is usually quite different from all the rest. Another important concept to get out of the way is machine code (often called binary code, or object code). People sometimes make the mistake of thinking that machine code is “faster” or “lower-level” than assembly language. That is a misconception: machine code and assembly language are two different representations of the same thing. A CPU reads machine code, which is nothing but sequences of bits that contain a list of instructions for the CPU to perform. Assembly language is simply a textual representation of those bits—we name elements in these code sequences in order to make them human-readable. Instead of cryptic hexadecimal numbers we can look at textual instruction names such as MOV (Move), XCHG (Exchange), and so on. Each assembly language command is represented by a number, called the operation code, or opcode. Object code is essentially a sequence of opcodes and other numbers used in connection with the opcodes to perform operations. CPUs constantly read object code from memory, decode it, and act based on the instructions embedded in it. When developers write code in assembly language (a fairly rare occurrence these days), they use an assembler program to translate the textual assembly language code into binary code, which can be decoded by a CPU. In the other direction and more relevant to our narrative, a disassembler does the exact opposite. It reads object code and generates the textual mapping of each instruction in it. This is a relatively simple operation to perform because the textual assembly language is simply a different representation of the object code. Disassemblers are a key tool for reversers and are discussed in more depth later in this chapter. Because assembly language is a platform-specific affair, we need to choose a specific platform to focus on while studying the language and practicing reversing. I’ve decided to focus on the Intel IA-32 architecture, on which every 32-bit PC is based. This choice is an easy one to make, considering the popularity of PCs and of this architecture. IA-32 is one of the most common CPU architectures in the world, and if you’re planning on learning reversing and assembly language and have no specific platform in mind, go with IA-32. The architecture and assembly language of IA-32-based CPUs are introduced in Chapter 2. Compilers and generates a corresponding machine code file. Depending on the high-level language, this machine code can either be a standard platform-specific object code that is decoded directly by the CPU or it can be encoded in a special platform-independent format called bytecode (see the following section on bytecodes). Compilers of traditional (non-bytecode-based) programming languages such as C and C++ directly generate machine-readable object code from the textual source code. What this means is that the resulting object code, when translated to assembly language by a disassembler, is essentially a machinegenerated assembly language program. Of course, it is not entirely machinegenerated, because the software developer described to the compiler what needed to be done in the high-level language. But the details of how things are carried out are taken care of by the compiler, in the resulting object code. This is an important point because this code is not always easily understandable, even when compared to a man-made assembly language program—machines think differently than human beings. The biggest hurdle in deciphering compiler-generated code is the optimizations applied by most modern compilers. Compilers employ a variety of techniques that minimize code size and improve execution performance. The problem is that the resulting optimized code is often counterintuitive and difficult to read. For instance, optimizing compilers often replace straightforward instructions with mathematically equivalent operations whose purpose can be far from obvious at first glance. Significant portions of this book are dedicated to the art of deciphering machine-generated assembly language. We will be studying some compiler basics in Chapter 2 and proceed to specific techniques that can be used to extract meaningful information from compiler-generated code. Virtual Machines and Bytecodes don’t need to worry about platform compatibility. All they must do is provide their customers with a bytecode version of their program. Customers must in turn obtain a virtual machine that is compatible with both the specific bytecode language and with their specific platform. The program should then (in theory at least) run on the user’s platform with no modifications or platformspecific work. This book primarily focuses on reverse engineering of native executable programs generated by native machine code compilers. Reversing programs written in bytecode-based languages is an entirely different process that is often much simpler compared to the process of reversing native executables. Chapter 12 focuses on reversing techniques for programs written for Microsoft’s .NET platform, which uses a virtual machine and a low-level bytecode language. Operating Systems An operating system is a program that manages the computer, including the hardware and software applications. An operating system takes care of many different tasks and can be seen as a kind of coordinator between the different elements in a computer. Operating systems are such a key element in a computer that any reverser must have a good understanding of what they do and how they work. As we’ll see later on, many reversing techniques revolve around the operating system because the operating system serves as a gatekeeper that controls the link between applications and the outside world. Chapter 3 provides an introduction to modern operating system architectures and operating system internals, and demonstrates the connection between operating systems and reverse-engineering techniques. The Reversing Process System-Level Reversing System-level reversing involves running various tools on the program and utilizing various operating system services to obtain information, inspect program executables, track program input and output, and so forth. Most of this information comes from the operating system, because by definition every interaction that a program has with the outside world must go through the operating system. This is the reason why reversers must understand operating systems—they can be used during reversing sessions to obtain a wealth of information about the target program being investigated. I will be discussing operating system basics in Chapter 3 and proceed to introduce the various tools commonly used for system-level reversing in Chapter 4. Code-Level Reversing Code-level reversing is really an art form. Extracting design concepts and algorithms from a program binary is a complex process that requires a mastery of reversing techniques along with a solid understanding of software development, the CPU, and the operating system. Software can be highly complex, and even those with access to a program’s well-written and properly-documented source code are often amazed at how difficult it can be to comprehend. Deciphering the sequences of low-level instructions that make up a program is usually no mean feat. But fear not, the focus of this book is to provide you with the knowledge, tools, and techniques needed to perform effective code-level reversing. Before covering any actual techniques, you must become familiar with some software-engineering essentials. Code-level reversing observes the code from a very low-level, and we’ll be seeing every little detail of how the software operates. Many of these details are generated automatically by the compiler and not manually by the software developer, which sometimes makes it difficult to understand how they relate to the program and to its functionality. That is why reversing requires a solid understanding of the low-level aspects of software, including the link between high-level and low-level programming constructs, assembly language, and the inner workings of compilers. These topics are discussed in Chapter 2. The Tools introduces the specific tools that will be used throughout this book. Let’s take a brief look at the different types of tools you will be dealing with. System-Monitoring Tools System-level reversing requires a variety of tools that sniff, monitor, explore, and otherwise expose the program being reversed. Most of these tools display information gathered by the operating system about the application and its environment. Because almost all communications between a program and the outside world go through the operating system, the operating system can usually be leveraged to extract such information. System-monitoring tools can monitor networking activity, file accesses, registry access, and so on. There are also tools that expose a program’s use of operating system objects such as mutexes, pipes, events, and so forth. Many of these tools will be discussed in Chapter 4 and throughout this book. Disassemblers As I described earlier, disassemblers are programs that take a program’s executable binary as input and generate textual files that contain the assembly language code for the entire program or parts of it. This is a relatively simple process considering that assembly language code is simply the textual mapping of the object code. Disassembly is a processor-specific process, but some disassemblers support multiple CPU architectures. A high-quality disassembler is a key component in a reverser’s toolkit, yet some reversers prefer to just use the built-in disassemblers that are embedded in certain low-level debuggers (described next). Debuggers Debuggers allow users to trace through a program while it is running (this is also known as single-stepping). Tracing means the program executes one line of code and then freezes, allowing the user to observe or even alter the program’s state. The user can then execute the next line and repeat the process. This allows developers to view the exact flow of a program at a pace more appropriate for human comprehension, which is about a billion times slower than the pace the program usually runs in. By installing breakpoints and tracing through programs, developers can watch a program closely as it executes a problematic section of code and try to determine the source of the problem. Because developers have access to the source code of their program, debuggers present the program in source-code form, and allow developers to set breakpoints and trace through source lines, even though the debugger is actually working with the machine code underneath. For a reverser, the debugger is almost as important as it is to a software developer, but for slightly different reasons. First and foremost, reversers use debuggers in disassembly mode. In disassembly mode, a debugger uses a built-in disassembler to disassemble object code on the fly. Reversers can step through the disassembled code and essentially “watch” the CPU as it’s running the program one instruction at a time. Just as with the source-level debugging performed by software developers, reversers can install breakpoints in locations of interest in the disassembled code and then examine the state of the program. For some reversing tasks, the only thing you are going to need is a good debugger with good built-in disassembly capabilities. Being able to step through the code and watch as it is executed is really an invaluable element in the reversing process. Decompilers Decompilers are the next step up from disassemblers. A decompiler takes an executable binary file and attempts to produce readable high-level language code from it. The idea is to try and reverse the compilation process, to obtain the original source file or something similar to it. On the vast majority of platforms, actual recovery of the original source code isn’t really possible. There are significant elements in most high-level languages that are just omitted during the compilation process and are impossible to recover. Still, decompilers are powerful tools that in some situations and environments can reconstruct a highly readable source code from a program binary. Chapter 13 discusses the process of decompilation and its limitations, and demonstrates just how effective it can be. Is Reversing Legal? The legal debate around reverse engineering has been going on for years. It usually revolves around the question of what social and economic impact reverse engineering has on society as a whole. Of course, calculating this kind of impact largely depends on what reverse engineering is used for. The following sections discuss the legal aspects of the various applications of reverse engineering, with an emphasis on the United States. It should be noted that it is never going to be possible to accurately predict beforehand whether a particular reversing scenario is going to be considered legal or not—that depends on many factors. Always seek legal counsel before getting yourself into any high-risk reversing project. The following sections should provide general guidelines on what types of scenarios should be considered high risk. Interoperability Getting two programs to communicate and interoperate is never an easy task. Even within a single product developed by a single group of people, there are frequently interfacing issues caused when attempting to get individual components to interoperate. Software interfaces are so complex and the programs are so sensitive that these things rarely function properly on the first attempt. It is just the nature of the technology. When a software developer wishes to develop software that communicates with a component developed by another company, there are large amounts of information that must be exposed by the other party regarding the interfaces. A software platform is any program or hardware device that programs can run on top of. For example, both Microsoft Windows and Sony Playstation are software platforms. For a software platform developer, the decision of whether to publish or to not publish the details of the platform’s software interfaces is a critical one. On one hand, exposing software interfaces means that other developers will be able to develop software that runs on top of the platform. This could drive sales of the platform upward, but the vendor might also be offering their own software that runs on the platform. Publishing software interfaces would also create new competition for the vendor’s own applications. The various legal aspects that affect this type of reverse engineering such as copyright laws, trade secret protections, and patents are discussed in the following sections. Competition When used for interoperability, reverse engineering clearly benefits society because it simplifies (or enables) the development of new and improved technologies. When reverse engineering is used in the development of competing products, the situation is slightly more complicated. Opponents of reverse engineering usually claim that reversing stifles innovation because developers of new technologies have little incentive to invest in research and development if their technologies can be easily “stolen” by competitors through reverse engineering. This brings us to the question of what exactly constitutes reverse engineering for the purpose of developing a competing product. The most extreme example is to directly steal code segments from a competitor’s product and embed them into your own. This is a clear violation of copyright laws and is typically very easy to prove. A more complicated example is SEGA VERSUS ACCOLADE In 1990 Sega Enterprises, a well-known Japanese gaming company, released their Genesis gaming console. The Genesis’s programming interfaces were not published. The idea was for Sega and their licensed affiliates to be the only developers of games for the console. Accolade, a California-based game developer, was interested in developing new games for the Sega Genesis and in porting some of their existing games to the Genesis platform. Accolade explored the option of becoming a Sega licensee, but quickly abandoned the idea because Sega required that all games be exclusively manufactured for the Genesis console. Instead of becoming a Sega licensee Accolade decided to use reverse engineering to obtain the details necessary to port their games to the Genesis platform. Accolade reverse engineered portions of the Genesis console and several of Sega’s game cartridges. Accolade engineers then used the information gathered in these reverse-engineering sessions to produce a document that described their findings. This internal document was essentially the missing documentation describing how to develop games for the Sega Genesis console. Accolade successfully developed and sold several games for the Genesis platform, and in October of 1991 was sued by Sega for copyright infringement. The primary claim made by Sega was that copies made by Accolade during the reverse-engineering process (known as “intermediate copying”) violated copyright laws. The court eventually ruled in Accolade’s favor because Accolade’s games didn’t actually contain any of Sega’s code, and because of the public benefit resulting from Accolade’s work (by way of introducing additional competition in the market). This was an important landmark in the legal history of reverse engineering because in this ruling the court essentially authorized reverse engineering for the purpose of interoperability. to apply some kind of decompilation process to a program and recompile its output in a way that generates a binary with identical functionality but with seemingly different code. This is similar to the previous example, except that in this case it might be far more difficult to prove that code had actually been stolen. Finally, a more relevant (and ethical) kind of reverse engineering in a competing product situation is one where reverse engineering is applied only to small parts of a product and is only used for the gathering of information, and not code. In these cases most of the product is developed independently without any use of reverse engineering and only the most complex and unique areas of the competitor’s product are reverse engineered and reimplemented in the new product. Copyright Law Copyright laws aim to protect software and other intellectual property from any kind of unauthorized duplication, and so on. The best example of where copyright laws apply to reverse engineering is in the development of competing software. As I described earlier, in software there is a very fine line between directly stealing a competitor’s code and reimplementing it. One thing that is generally considered a violation of copyright law is to directly copy protected code sequences from a competitor’s product into your own product, but there are other, far more indefinite cases. How does copyright law affect the process of reverse engineering a competitor’s code for the purpose of reimplementing it in your own product? In the past, opponents of reverse engineering have claimed that this process violates copyright law because of the creation of intermediate copies during the reverse-engineering process. Consider the decompilation of a program as an example. In order to decompile a program, that program must be duplicated at least once, either in memory, on disk, or both. The idea is that even if the actual decompilation is legal, this intermediate copying violates copyright law. However, this claim has not held up in courts; there have been several cases including Sega v. Accolade and Sony v. Connectix, where intermediate copying was considered fair use, primarily because the final product did not actually contain anything that was directly copied from the original product. From a technological perspective, this makes perfect sense—intermediate copies are always created while software is being used, regardless of reverse engineering. Consider what happens when a program is installed from an optical media such as a DVD-ROM onto a hard-drive—a copy of the software is made. This happens again when that program is launched—the executable file on disk is duplicated into memory in order for the code to be executed. Trade Secrets and Patents When a new technology is developed, developers are usually faced with two primary options for protecting the unique aspects of it. In some cases, filing a patent is the right choice. The benefit of patenting is that it grants the inventor or patent owner control of the invention for up to almost 20 years. The main catches for the inventor are that the details of the invention must be published and that after the patent expires the invention essentially becomes public domain. Of course, reverse engineering of patented technologies doesn’t make any sense because the information is publicly available anyway. A newly developed technology that isn’t patented automatically receives the legal protection of a trade secret if significant efforts are put into its development and to keeping it confidential. A trade secret legally protects the developer from cases of “trade-secret misappropriation” such as having a rogue employee sell the secret to a competitor. However, a product’s being a trade secret does not protect its owner in cases where a competitor reverse engineers the owner’s product, assuming that product is available on the open market and is obtained legitimately. Having a trade secret also offers no protection in the case of a competitor independently inventing the same technology—that’s exactly what patents are for. The Digital Millenium Copyright Act The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) has been getting much publicity these past few years. As funny as it may sound, the basic purpose of the DMCA, which was enacted in 1998, is to protect the copyright protection technologies. The idea is that the copyright protection technologies in themselves are vulnerable and that legislative action must be taken to protect them. Seriously, the basic idea behind the DMCA is that it legally protects copyright protection systems from circumvention. Of course, “circumvention of copyright protection systems” almost always involves reversing, and that is why the DMCA is the closest thing you’ll find in the United States Code to an antireverse-engineering law. However, it should be stressed that the DMCA only applies to copyright protection systems, which are essentially DRM technologies. The DMCA does not apply to any other type of copyrighted software, so many reversing applications are not affected by it at all. Still, what exactly is prohibited under the DMCA? ■■ Circumvention of copyright protection systems : This means that a person may not defeat a Digital Rights Management technology, even for personal use. There are several exceptions where this is permitted, which are discussed later in this section. ■■ The development of circumvention technologies : This means that a person may not develop or make available any product or technology that circumvents a DRM technology. In case you’re wondering: Yes, the average keygen program qualifies. In fact, a person developing a keygen violates this section, and a person using a keygen violates the previous one. ■■ In case you’re truly a law-abiding citizen, a keygen is a program that generates a serial number on the fly for programs that request a serial number during installation. Keygens are (illegally) available online for practically any program that requires a serial number. Copy protections and keygens are discussed in depth in Part III of this book. Luckily, the DMCA makes several exceptions in which circumvention is allowed. Here is a brief examination of each of the exemptions provided in the DMCA: ■■ Interoperability : reversing and circumventing DRM technologies may be allowed in circumstances where such work is needed in order to interoperate with the software product in question. For example, if a program was encrypted for the purpose of copy protecting it, a software developer may decrypt the program in question if that’s the only way to interoperate with it. ■■ Encryption research : There is a highly restricted clause in the DMCA that allows researchers of encryption technologies to circumvent copyright protection technologies in encryption products. Circumvention is only allowed if the protection technologies interfere with the evaluation of the encryption technology. ■■ Security testing : A person may reverse and circumvent copyright protection software for the purpose of evaluating or improving the security of a computer system. ■■ Educational institutions and public libraries : These institutions may circumvent a copyright protection technology in order to evaluate the copyrighted work prior to purchasing it. ■■ Government investigation : Not surprisingly, government agencies conducting investigations are not affected by the DMCA. ■■ Regulation : DRM Technologies may be circumvented for the purpose of regulating the materials accessible to minors on the Internet. So, a theoretical product that allows unmonitored and uncontrolled Internet browsing may be reversed for the purpose of controlling a minor’s use of the Internet. DMCA Cases The DMCA is relatively new as far as laws go, and therefore it hasn’t really been used extensively so far. There have been several high-profile cases in which the DMCA was invoked. Let’s take a brief look at two of those cases. Felten vs. RIAA : In September, 2000, the SDMI (Secure Digital Music Initiative) announced the Hack SDMI challenge. The Hack SDMI challenge was a call for security researchers to test the level of security offered by SDMI, a digital rights management system designed to protect audio recordings (based on watermarks). Princeton university professor Edward Felten and his research team found weaknesses in the system and wrote a paper describing their findings [Craver]. The original Hack SDMI challenge offered a $10,000 reward in return for giving up ownership of the information gathered. Felten’s team chose to forego this reward and retain ownership of the information in order to allow them to publish their findings. At this point, they received legal threats from SDMI and the RIAA (the Recording Industry Association of America) claiming liability under the DMCA. The team decided to withdraw their paper from the original conference to which it was submitted, but were eventually able to publish it at the USENIX Security Symposium. The sad thing about this whole story is that it is a classic case where the DMCA could actually reduce the level of security provided by the devices it was created to protect. Instead of allowing security researchers to publish their findings and force the developers of the security device to improve their product, the DMCA can be used for stifling the very process of open security research that has been historically proven to create the most robust security systems. License Agreement Considerations In light of the fact that other than the DMCA there are no laws that directly prohibit or restrict reversing, and that the DMCA only applies to DRM products or to software that contains DRM technologies, software vendors add anti-reverse-engineering clauses to shrink-wrap software license agreements. That’s that very lengthy document you are always told to “accept” when installing practically any software product in the world. It should be noted that in most cases just using a program provides the legal equivalent of signing its license agreement (assuming that the user is given an opportunity to view it). The main legal question around reverse-engineering clauses in license agreements is whether they are enforceable. In the U.S., there doesn’t seem to be a single, authoritative answer to this question—it all depends on the specific circumstances in which reverse engineering is undertaken. In the European Union this issue has been clearly defined by the Directive on the Legal Protection of Computer Programs [EC1]. This directive defines that decompilation of software programs is permissible in cases of interoperability. The directive overrides any shrink-wrap license agreements, at least in this matter. Code Samples & Tools This book contains many code samples and demonstrates many reversing tools. In an effort to avoid any legal minefields, particularly those imposed by the DMCA, this book deals primarily with sample programs that were specifically created for this purpose. There are several areas where third-party code is reversed, but this is never code that is in any way responsible for protecting copyrighted materials. Likewise, I have intentionally avoided any tool whose primary purpose is reversing or defeating any kind of security mechanisms. All of the tools used in this book are either generic reverse-engineering tools or simply software development tools (such as debuggers) that are doubled as This chapter provides an introduction to low-level software, which is a critical aspect of the field of reverse engineering. Low-level software is a general name for the infrastructural aspects of the software world. Because the low-level aspects of software are often the only ones visible to us as reverse engineers, we must develop a firm understanding of these layers that together make up the realm of low-level software. This chapter opens with a very brief overview of the conventional, high-level perspective of software that every software developer has been exposed to. We then proceed to an introduction of low-level software and demonstrate how fundamental high-level software concepts map onto the low-level realm. This is followed by an introduction to assembly language, which is a key element in the reversing process and an important part of this book. Finally, we introduce several auxiliary low-level software topics that can assist in low-level software comprehension: compilers and software execution environments. If you are an experienced software developer, parts of this chapter might seem trivial, particularly the high-level perspectives in the first part of this chapter. If that is the case, it is recommended that you start reading from the section titled “Low-Level Perspectives” later in this chapter, which provides a low-level perspective on familiar software development concepts.'}"
