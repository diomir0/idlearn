       "{'Chapter 7: Manic-Depression': ' IN THE ERA BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF DRUGS, MANIC-DEPRESSION AS A diagnosis was a kind of clinical no-man’s-land, bounded by schizophrenia on the one side and depression on the other. It was given to patients who had bouts of agitation such that they did not seem to suffer just from depression yet who also, for whatever reason, did not seem quite ill enough to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Such patients were then generally subjected to any and all the treatments used for schizophrenia or depression— psychotherapy, electroshock treatment, lobotomy—and the outcomes were generally less than ideal. THE INVENTION OF MANIC-DEPRESSION It was not supposed to be like this. Manic-depression was the “other” psychosis in Emil Kraepelin’s bipartite division of the psychoses. The diagnostic category had been his attempt to synthesize and bring order to the whole vexed subject of mood disorders, including (but not limited to) disorders that fluctuated between pathological agitation (with or without elation) and despondent listlessness. The roots of the confusion he was sorting out, in his view, were old indeed. For centuries, a disorder called “mania” and a disorder called “melancholy” had divided the world of mental illness into two halves. Mania was any form of madness in which a person was furious, raving, or agitated, whereas “melancholy” was any form of madness in which a person brooded unceasingly over imagined slights or sins, was wracked by despondency, or was immobilized by indecisiveness. To reinforce the consensus, for 150 years (from 1676 to 1815), visitors to the gates of London’s Bethlem Royal Hospital (widely known as Bedlam) were greeted by two giant statues, Mania and Melancholy, carved by the Danish sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber. Melancholy was shown lying on his left side, placid and despondent. Raving Madness, by contrast, was shown on his right side, straining with clenched fists against the chains restraining him. In the mid-nineteenth century, though, a small number of clinicians, mostly based in France, began to say that some patients were neither exclusively manic nor exclusively melancholic but had periods in which they were one or the other. They gave this condition various names: circular insanity, intermittent insanity, periodic insanity, and insanity of double form. It came to be considered a serious form of madness. Each new round of attacks was believed to progressively weaken the mind in ways that ultimately led to dementia. No one was supposed to ever recover from the mental scars of circular insanity. In 1882, however, the German asylum physician Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum proposed the existence of at least one type of circular insanity that was different from the ones highlighted by the French. It affected only moods and did not lead over time to permanent dementia. He felt it needed a new name, and so he proposed to call it “cyclothymia” (a combination of the Greek kuklos , “circle,” and thūmós , “temper/disposition”). He further proposed calling the excited states of this new disorder “hyperthymia” and the depressive states “dysthymia.” By the late nineteenth century, the conversation about mood states had become pretty complicated. Many clinicians still referenced the original circular insanity described by the French, in which patients cycled between acute attacks of mania and melancholy and ended up mentally impaired. Others had adopted Kahlbaum’s new syndrome, cyclothymia, in which the cycling seemed to affect only moods and did not cause intellectual degeneration. These periodic sorts of mood disorders coexisted alongside a wide range of other recognized disorders that were believed to be variants of mania or melancholy, each of which in turn was said to present in a “simple” form that affected mood alone, or in a “chronic” form that involved delusions and mental confusion. In 1899 Emil Kraepelin took stock of all this and declared it incoherent. Forget circular insanity, he said. Forget cyclothymia, and all the various categories of mania and melancholy, be they simple or chronic. Having undertaken a longitudinal study of these syndromes, he had come to the conclusion that beneath their dramatic surface differences, all these disorders were different expressions of one and the same disease, which he proposed to call “manic-depressive insanity.” Manic-depressive insanity ... includes on the one hand the whole domain of so-called periodic and circular insanity, on the other hand simple mania, the greater part of the morbid states termed melancholia and also a not inconsiderable number of cases of amentia (confusional or delirious insanity). Lastly, we include here certain slight and slightest colourings of mood, some of them periodic, some of them continuously morbid, which on the one hand are to be regarded as the rudiment of more severe disorders, on the other hand pass without sharp boundaries into the domain of personal predisposition.... I have become more and more convinced that all of the above-mentioned states only represent manifestations of a single morbid process. By creating the category of manic-depressive insanity, Kraepelin was proposing a distinction between this disorder and dementia praecox or schizophrenia (a distinction that he later confessed was sometimes less clear than he had originally proposed). But he was also, with the stroke of a pen, proposing to eliminate the centuries-old category of melancholy (depression) as a distinct disease. Persuasive as he was on so many fronts, Kraepelin ultimately could not persuade all his colleagues to accept this second proposal. So it happened that, in the early twentieth century and beyond, depression (vital, endogenous, psychotic) persisted as a diagnostic category that was used alongside manic-depression (see Chapter 6). The first DSM , published in 1952, described “manic-depressive psychosis” as a disorder a bit like schizophrenia (in that it sometimes included hallucinations and delusions), and a bit like depression (in that it generally included episodes of deep despair and listlessness)—but distinct from both. It was distinct above all because it was “marked by severe mood swings, and a tendency to remit and recur.” Care needed to be taken in particular, the DSM authors made clear, to distinguish this disorder from a “psychotic depressive reaction,” which was marked by an “absence of history of repeated depressions or of marked cyclothymic mood swings.” THE PATIENTS NO ONE LIKED As the diagnostic category “manic-depressive insanity” found its somewhat unstable place in the lexicon of American psychiatry, a consensus also took hold that people with this disorder were distinctively difficult to treat—partly because they were so unlikable. Classical Freudian theory had described them as developmentally stalled somewhere between the “second biting oral phase” and the “first expelling anal phase.” This had made them prone to fantasies focused on feces, death, and cannibalism. When psychoanalytically inclined clinicians paid attention to the family backgrounds of these patients, they focused less on the maternal roots of these patients’ psychic wounds (as they did with their schizophrenic patients) and far more on the extent to which these patients were as much a problem to their families as their families were to them. The manic-depressive patient is frequently the best endowed member of the family. He often occupies a special position in the family as a result of his own strivings, or because of some fortuitous circumstance such as being the eldest child or an only son. This leads him to guard his special position enviously and subjects him to the envy of the other siblings and the parents. Even Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, who was willing to accept gifts of feces from her schizophrenic patients (see Chapter 5), seems to have had difficulty mustering much compassion for manic-depressive patients. In the early 1950s, she summed up her view of the typical patient with this disorder. He was “a good manipulator, a salesman, a bargaining personality.” He was invariably hungry for “prestige” and became hugely anxious when “his manipulations fail.” Ultimately, she concluded, this kind of patient was dominated by “feelings of emptiness and envy.” THE WONDER DRUG THAT EVERYONE (ORIGINALLY) IGNORED In the end, the reputation of manic-depressive patients would be salvaged—dramatically. But the decisive factor in their rehabilitation was neither a new psychodynamic understanding of their personalities nor a new commitment to embracing them with unconditional regard. It was a new biological treatment—a drug called lithium. The path by which lithium emerged as a treatment for manic-depression has the feel of a shaggy dog story. During World War II, the Australian psychiatrist John Cade had been held as a prisoner of war by the Japanese on Singapore, where he witnessed bizarre manic behaviors among his fellow prisoners. He wondered whether they were a form of intoxication caused by some kind of endogenous toxin. Later, as a practicing psychiatrist in Australia, he tried to find evidence for the existence of such a toxin. If mania was caused by a toxin, he reasoned, then the urine of manic patients would likely contain a metabolite of it. So he collected urine from manic, schizophrenic, and control patients, and injected the samples into the abdomens of guinea pigs. All the guinea pigs went into convulsions and died, but Cade had the impression that those that had been injected with urine from manic patients did worse. That suggested to him that he was on the right track. Cade next faced the challenge of isolating the presumed toxic metabolite in the urine of his manic patients. Family members later recalled the vials of “manic urine in the family fridge,” as he pursued this work. He began by isolating salts of pure urea taken from the urine of the manic patients. He also took urea from the urine of schizophrenic and mentally healthy subjects to act as controls. He dissolved the salts and injected the solutions into guinea pigs. They all suffered fatal convulsions, and none of the groups seemed to do any better or worse than the others. This avenue having failed to yield insights, Cade turned his attention to uric acid, another component of urine. But uric acid presented him with a problem: he could not prepare an injectable solution of it because it does not readily dissolve in water. Some physiologists at the University of Melbourne then informed Cade that combining uric acid with a lithium salt would produce lithium urate, and lithium urate would readily dissolve in water. Cade took their advice, performed the injections, but then was startled by the results. This time none of the guinea pigs convulsed or died; it was as if the addition of lithium had somehow been protective. He then tested whether lithium salts injected on their own (he used lithium carbonate) had any effects. The results were even more striking: the normally skittish animals became lethargic and placid. When placed on their backs, instead of frantically trying to right themselves, they just lay there, apparently content. The striking sight of “chilled out” guinea pigs led Cade to wonder if lithium salts were the treatment for the “manic” toxin that he had been trying to find. As he would later conclude in a 1949 publication, “It may seem a long way from lethargy in guinea pigs to the control of manic excitement, but as these investigations had commenced in an attempt to demonstrate some possibly excreted toxin in the urine of manic patients, the association of ideas is explicable.” Wasting no time, Cade ingested some lithium carbonate himself to determine its safety and was soon satisfied on that score. He then conducted an open clinical trial in which either lithium carbonate or lithium citrate was given to ten patients with mania, six with schizophrenia, and six with chronic major depression. Only the manic patients improved, he reported, and some very dramatically. His first case, identified only by the initials W.B., was “restless, dirty, destructive, mischievous and interfering” and “had long been regarded as the most troublesome patient in the ward.” After completing a course of treatment, W.B. was a changed man. He left the hospital on July 9, 1948, and was “soon back working happily at his old job.” The results of Cade’s lithium experiments were published some three years before the first open trials of chlorpromazine as a treatment for schizophrenia led to an explosion of interest in the use of pharmaceutics in psychiatry. Cade’s astonishing claims about the antimanic effects of lithium, however, were passed over almost in silence. Another twenty-five years would go by before lithium would truly come into its own and usher manic-depression into the new world of biological psychiatry. To understand the decades-long delay, we must understand a few things about lithium. Unlike all the other psychoactive drugs of the 1950s and ’60s, lithium compounds were not developed in commercial laboratories. They exist naturally. Discovered in the early nineteenth century, lithium is the lightest metallic element, akin to other alkali metals—sodium, potassium, and three other less-familiar elements. Like them, it is malleable, a good conductor of heat and electricity, and highly reactive with the halogen elements fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Salts of alkali metals are also readily soluble in water. Over the years, lithium’s properties and relative abundance enabled it to become an ingredient in many useful products that had nothing to do with mental illness. Combined with other elements and compounds, it improved the performance of ceramic glazes, batteries, and lubricating greases. In the 1950s it was a secret ingredient used to help fuel the first atomic fusion bombs. But lithium’s most time-honored use, perhaps tellingly, was as a medication and health tonic. In the mid-nineteenth century, its various compounds were used to dissolve bladder stones and gallstones, and to treat migraines, epilepsy, and eczema. Some clinicians used it to treat gout, a disorder caused by pathological levels of uric acid salts. Believing that some uric acid deposits could infiltrate the brain, the English physician Sir Alfred Baring Garrod used lithium compounds to treat what he called “brain gout,” but that psychiatrists today would probably consider to be symptoms of depression. The Danish brothers Carl and Fritz Lange also believed that unusual levels of uric acid in the blood could cause mental problems and that lithium salts could help. Although Cade never mentioned that he was familiar with the nineteenth-century literature that touted lithium as a remedy for “brain gout,” there is at least circumstantial evidence that he was, and that this familiarity shaped his interest in its possible use as medicine for mood disorders. By the late nineteenth century, lithium lost its status as a medication prescribed by physicians for specific disorders; it became instead a popular health tonic with commercial value. Famous mineral water companies such as Vichy and Perrier promoted the high lithium content of their waters, which they insisted was particularly beneficial for people with “bad nerves.” In 1929 the American entrepreneur Charles Leiper Grigg made lithium the central selling point of a new soft drink he developed for the Howdy Corporation, “ Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda.” A doctor who endorsed the beverage testified that it provided customers with “an abundance of energy, enthusiasm, a clear complexion, lustrous hair, and shining eyes.” Grigg later came up with a punchier slogan for his soda, “You Like It, It Likes You,” and he rebranded it “7 Up.” No one is sure why Grigg chose that name, but one theory is that it had to do with lithium: 7 is the rounded-up atomic weight of lithium (6.9), and “up” might allude to the element’s alleged power to lift spirits. Be that as it may, lithium remained an ingredient of 7 Up until 1950, when it was removed. At about this time, the reputation of lithium as a health tonic took a decided nose dive, because of a scandal over its use as a salt substitute for patients with high blood pressure. Lithium chloride, one of the many compounds of lithium, happens to have a salty taste, and in the 1940s certain American companies had begun to market lithium chloride as a salt alternative, under such brand names as Westsal, Foodsal, Salti-salt, and Milosal. In early 1949, scandal broke when Time magazine ran an article, “Case of the Substitute Salt,” and quoted various clinicians who believed that the products were not safe, especially for patients with high blood pressure or heart disease—precisely the patients who might be tempted to use a salt substitute. Several weeks later the Journal of the American Medical Association published corroborating letters and reports from other clinicians. Some patients using the products, they reported, had developed tremors, weakness, blurred vision, and unstable gait. In at least two cases, lithium poisoning was believed to have contributed to death. The FDA now issued its own warning: “Stop using this dangerous poison at once.” All this happened the same year Cade published his article touting lithium as a safe and effective antimanic drug. And again, his claim was almost completely ignored. THE GREAT “MOOD NORMALIZER” DEBATE Nevertheless a few years later, Erik Strömgren, head of the State Hospital for Psychiatric Research at Aarhus University in Denmark, attended a conference in Paris, where Cade’s work on lithium as an antimanic treatment was mentioned. His interest was piqued not only by Cade’s original study but also by a report that a pair of clinicians in Australia, Charles Noack and Edward Trautner, had verified Cade’s claims more systematically using a much larger patient pool. These two researchers had also tackled the problem of lithium’s potential toxicity by showing that the risks of poisoning were minimized if patients’ blood serum levels were monitored throughout treatment. Strömgren asked his research assistant, Mogens Schou, to look further into the matter. Schou happened to have a younger brother who, since the age of twenty-five, had suffered recurrent, debilitating attacks of cyclical depression (seen by some as a variant of manic-depression). Schou was thus personally motivated to explore even implausible treatment options if they showed any promise at all. And Schou did find Cade’s claims in the original paper to be implausible. The experimental design, as he later recalled, was “not particularly clear.” The conclusions seemed likely unsound: “Those guinea pigs probably did not just show altered behavior; they were presumably quite ill.” Nevertheless, Noack and Trautner’s follow-up work led Schou to conclude that Cade might have stumbled onto something profoundly important, perhaps despite himself. Over the next two years, he and his colleagues in Denmark investigated lithium, using a method very familiar today but quite novel back then: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Some thirty-eight manic patients were randomly allocated into two groups. One group received treatment, the other a placebo. No one, including the evaluating clinicians, knew which was which. The results, published in 1954, found an 84 percent likely or possible effect: 14 of the 38 patients responded strongly to the drug, and a further 18 improved, “but a spontaneous cessation of the mania could not be excluded.” Only six patients showed no appreciable response. This study—like Cade’s original report—initially attracted little attention. Manic-depression was just the “other” psychosis, the afterthought psychosis. Nevertheless, while attention was focused elsewhere, a colleague of Schou’s, Poul Christian Baastrup, quietly carried out a further clinical trial of his own. It was designed simply to confirm that lithium’s effects were specific to mania (i.e., that the drug did not simply suppress states of excitation in general). It did not seem earth shattering, until matters took an unexpected turn. Baastrup’s protocol required him to follow up with patients who had been discharged from the hospital after a successful course of lithium treatment. Because lithium’s potential toxicity was a real concern, all these patients had been ordered to cease taking lithium immediately upon discharge. Years later Baastrup recalled the “hair-raising” discovery that not only had eight of the patients continued to take lithium, against all orders, but two of them had even handed out these “miracle pills” (as they saw them) to relatives with the same disease. They told him, “Their reason for continuing the treatment in spite of our agreement was... that continuous lithium treatment prevented psychotic relapse .” Something was wrong, Baastrup thought. His manic-depressive patients were claiming that the same drug, a simple element, was acting to prevent both psychotic manic attacks and psychotic descent into depression. It made no sense to him. Drugs either tranquilized or energized, it was thought—a single drug could not do both. Unless that thinking was wrong. Baastrup discussed the situation with his colleague Schou. The two men agreed that, whether it made sense or not, the evidence, at least anecdotally, seemed strong. Schou even decided to put his own brother, still struggling with cycles of crippling depression, on a preventive course of lithium treatment. The brother seemed to stabilize. Urged on by a now enthusiastic Schou, in 1964 Baastrup published a short observational study involving eleven patients. In this report, he asserted for the first time that lithium was not only a useful drug for mania; when taken on a long-term basis, it could also act as a prophylactic, suppressing both the ups and the downs of manic-depression. Such an unprecedented claim was not going to be an easy sell. Baastrup’s article came out during a time when concern was growing about the potential for long-term abuse of some of the popular mind-altering drugs on the market—especially the amphetamines and minor tranquilizers. He and Schou thus undertook to demonstrate that lithium did not have the same potential for abuse. To that end, the two men and at least one other colleague ingested therapeutic levels of lithium to see what effect the drug had on what they called “normal minds.” The answer was, very little. They all felt some initial nausea, and their hands developed slight tremors. Some also reported a certain muscular heaviness and a slight sensation of “slowing.” One of the unnamed participants in this informal study reported that his family found him more congenial. Another wryly reported that his family thought he had become “too dull.” But if the changes were real, they were subtle. And the results strengthened the Danish researchers’ view that lithium was different from other drugs on the market. It did not alter the mind. It simply stabilized and normalized it. By 1967, convinced that the evidence now warranted taking the research to the next level, Baastrup and Schou collaborated on a study that incorporated more than six years of data. It involved close to ninety Danish female manic-depressive patients who had undergone lithium treatment for at least twelve months. Using hospital records, Baastrup and Schou were able to show that prior to long-term lithium treatment, relapses within this group had occurred on average every eight months. Once the patients were on lithium, relapses occurred only once every 60 to 85 months and were of notably shorter duration. Nevertheless, the results failed to persuade skeptics, least of all an influential group of psychiatrists at London’s Maudsley Hospital. Given the known dangers of lithium, the hype about its miraculous benefits was, they insisted, a dangerous “therapeutic myth.” Two of the Maudsley clinicians, Barry Blackwell and Michael Shepherd, further summed up their position in a pointed letter to the American Journal of Psychiatry , where they compared advocates of lithium to “the honest, well-intentioned enthusiasts who championed the ducking stool, purging, bleeding, and even insulin.” No one should be using a treatment like this, they concluded, absent “proper controlled evaluation.” Nothing less than a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial would do. These attacks mortified Schou and Baastrup. If prophylactic lithium treatment stood any chance of surviving, they realized, they would have to subject it to what was increasingly recognized as the most rigorous approach to clinical testing: a placebo-controlled trial. But the thought of such a trial left them highly distraught, because it meant some of their patients would have to go off the drug and onto the placebo. That prospect seemed unconscionable, as by now they were personally convinced that the drug was all that stood between their patients and insanity—even suicide. Even naysayer Blackwell later ruefully admitted that, in calling for a placebo-controlled trial of lithium treatment, he and his colleagues had “underestimated the understandable concerns about safety and suicide.” Nevertheless, Schou and his colleagues bit the bullet and designed the trial. Patients who had been on a course of continuous lithium treatment for at least a year (some as long as seven years) were now randomly and blindly allocated to one of two equal groups, one to receive lithium, the other a placebo. The 1970 report of the five-month trial noted that twenty-one of the approximately forty-two patients who were taking placebos relapsed, while not one of the patients taking lithium did. So much effort, so much pain, and yet in the United States at least, little changed. Even after the results of Schou’s placebo-controlled trial were published, a very cautious FDA failed to budge. Eventually it did approve lithium as treatment, but only for acute mania, the original use for which it had been tested. It was a small step and much overdue. The United States was the fiftieth country to grant such approval. The question then became how American patients would access lithium. Pharmaceutical companies were not very interested in producing and marketing it because it could not be patented and so would not make them the significant profits they were now accustomed to getting from psychopharmaceutical products. Only after a personal appeal from members of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology did a few relent. Smith, Kline & French was one of the companies that agreed to sell lithium carbonate (under the brand name Eskalith), but only because its big moneymaker, Thorazine, was going off patent in 1970 and the company was reorienting its entire operational strategy anyway. Pfizer also agreed to sell lithium salts (under the brand name Lithane). It then seems to have decided to integrate its promotion of this less lucrative drug with the marketing of one of its patented drugs for schizophrenia, called Navane. A 1970 ad, which appeared in the American Journal of Psychiatry , reproduced The Creation of Adam , the fresco painting by Michelangelo, over two pages. The text on the left, above Adam, described Navane as “an important psychotherapeutic agent that helps schizophrenic patients to communicate.” Paired text on the right introduce Lithane as “the new psychotherapeutic agent that helps control manic episodes in manic-depressive patients.” The word “new” was used an additional two times in the continuing explanatory text to describe this drug. THE LITHIUM UNDERGROUND Even as lithium slowly made its way into the market as a treatment for controlling manic episodes, most clinicians who had followed the literature knew that the drug’s real interest lay in its ability to normalize patients’ moods over the long term. Lithium had not formally been approved for use as a mood normalizer, but clinicians found ways to work around this fact. Some filed Investigational New Drug (IND) applications that, once approved, allowed them to legally use the drug for uses other than those approved by the FDA. Others simply ignored the FDA regulations. In 1969 the New York Times reported on the rise of a “lithium underground” of rogue physicians who had decided to circumvent the law and do what they thought best: “Many psychiatrists, both in private practice and on hospital staffs are bringing in capsules from foreign drug houses or getting their corner pharmacists to buy some lithium from local chemical supply houses, and dispensing the medication to patients.” Some of these doctors took their case to the public. In 1974 one clinician, for example, urged the advice columnist Abigail Van Buren (“Dear Abby” writer Pauline Phillips) to tell a worried wife that medications were now available that might stabilize her suddenly erratic and moody husband. Others like Nathan Kline and Frederick Goodwin contributed to popular articles on lithium’s mood-stabilizing effects in publications ranging from Good Housekeeping to the New York Times . Some of the most compelling articles drew on dramatic personal testimonials. The title of a 1974 Newsday piece reads like a true confession potboiler: “How a Long Island Woman, Tormented by Wild Swings of Mood for 10 Years, Was Restored to a Normal Life by a Simple Drug Called Lithium.” The biggest public relations coup during these years, however, was scored by the psychiatrist Ronald Fieve. In the early 1970s, he persuaded his patient Joshua Logan (who began lithium maintenance treatment in 1969) to testify on television and in other public forums about his positive experiences with the medication. Logan’s testimony was riveting not only because of what he said but because of who he was: the brilliant playwright and director-producer of such Tony-winning musicals as Annie Get Your Gun , Camelot , and South Pacific . The climactic moment of his career as the human face of the benefits of long-term lithium treatment came in June 1973, when he spoke at a panel organized by the American Medical Association. As the New York Times reported his testimony: Mr. Logan said he had previously been treated over 20 years for “several ‘nervous breakdowns’ that were really manic elations—I would be going great guns, putting out a thousand ideas a minute, acting flamboyant—until I went over the bounds of reality” and was then caught up in a profound “wish to be dead without having to go through the shaming defeat of suicide.” Speaking quietly, with his fingers carefully interlaced and twiddling his thumbs, he said that the “aggravated agony” of the depression phase was “terrifying” and that “elation, its non-identical twin sister, is even more terrifying—attractive as she may be for a moment. You are grandiose beyond the reality of your creativity.” “It’s a little as though you got too close to the microphone and you blasted, and so nobody could understand what you said,” he suggested. He said he had been “tempered” by continuing dosages of lithium four times a day. As doctors and patients alike worked the court of public opinion, we also see, more and more, claims being made that the effectiveness of lithium also demonstrated the failure of the Freudian approach to mood disorders. The 1974 Newsday article about the Long Island woman with manic-depression explained that she had spent “thousands of dollars” on psychotherapy, and it had all been “money down the drain.” Lithium, in contrast, had been a “miracle drug,” the “savior” of an entire family. A year later, in 1975, Ronald Fieve came out with Moodswing , the first book specifically devoted to explaining manic-depression to the general public. It declared that the “lithium breakthrough” was helping to usher in a new revolutionary era in psychiatry—one based on biology rather than unproven psychological constructs: The lithium breakthrough... has clarified the fact that major mood disorders—which may at times be advantageous and productive— are stabilized by a simple, naturally occurring substance. Furthermore, findings point to the fact that mania and mental depression must be due to biochemical causes handed down through the genes, since they are correctable so rapidly by chemical rather than talking therapy. Some, picking up on this theme, suggested more specifically that manic-depression resulted from a kind of chemical “imbalance” in which neurotransmitter deficits first “damp down the circuits” to cause depression (in Nathan Kline’s words), while “surplus” neurotransmitters “produce the opposite manic effects.” The problem was that there was no evidence from laboratory studies or anywhere else in support of the idea that the highs and lows of manic-depression were caused by alternating deficits and surpluses of neurotransmitters. More to the point, the observation that a single drug could put the brakes on both highs and lows was hard to square with conventional “imbalance” talk. Even though no one really understood how lithium worked, it unquestionably helped turn manic-depression into a biochemical disease that could be treated pharmaceutically. In so doing, it also helped rehabilitate the character of patients who had previously been so often disliked. Tamed by lithium, they became sympathetic, appealing, even brilliant people who had simply been betrayed by their unruly biochemistry. As one patient told a New York Times journalist in 1978, “It’s not me , you see; it’s my biochemistry.” BIPOLAR DISORDER Even while the precise biochemistry of manic-depression remained mysterious, champions of manic-depression’s 1970s biological revolution could find comfort in the disorder’s inheritance patterns. Beginning in the 1960s, various twin studies had shown that the identical twin siblings of patients with manic-depression had close to a 70 percent chance of also suffering either from manic-depression or from another mood disturbance. The likelihood of fraternal twins both suffering from manic-depression was only about 20 percent. Adoption studies showed that the biological parents of adopted manic-depression patients had a 30 percent chance of also suffering from some kind of mood disorder (major depression or manic-depression), whereas the incidence within the pool of adoptive parents was only 2 percent. The most influential studies on the inheritance of manic-depression did more than simply confirm that the disorder was inherited in some way. In the eyes of some, they also provided significant new evidence that depression and manic-depression were different disorders and that Kraepelin had in fact overreached when he included depression within his capacious diagnostic category of manic-depression. In the late 1950s, the East German psychiatrist Karl Leonhard published evidence that the frequency of manic attacks was greater in the families of patients who were affected by the classical “circular” form of the disease than in patients who simply presented with depression. Because manic-depression had originally been used to categorize all the mood disorders, Leonhard felt the time was right to introduce some new, more useful terms to better capture the distinctions he believed he had demonstrated. He therefore proposed dropping the term manic-disorders that cycled, and unipolar to refer to those that did not. Leonhard was soon in good company. In the late 1960s Jules Angst in Switzerland and Carlo Perris in Sweden found differences in the family histories of patients who cycled and in those of patients who presented with only depression. The first American studies with conclusions similar to Leonhard’s were published in 1969 by three researchers at Washington University: George Winokur, Paula Clayton, and Theodore Reich. The Washington University studies are particularly important for our story because one of the researchers, George Winokur, was actively involved in drafting DSM-III , published in 1980. This helps explain the fact that this revision got rid of the expansive and fraught Kraepelinian term manic-depression and replaced it with Leonhard’s alternative, bipolar disorder . The committee recommending this change had considered using Leonhard’s term unipolar disorder for depression, but ultimately decided against it because, according to notes taken by committee members, the term unipolar “perturbed” some psychotherapists involved in the conversation. They worried that it “carried an implication of biological etiology.” Strangely, these same psychotherapists seem to have had no problem changing the name manic-depression to bipolar disorder . Did they think that term failed to carry any implication of biological etiology? Perhaps they did not care in the same way—as we know, most had never much liked, or had much success with, bipolar patients. As time passed, advocates and clinicians alike also increasingly felt that the term manic-depression was not just a relic of an older, excessively capacious understanding of mood disorders, but was also stigmatizing and misleading, not least because the term mania evoked images of wild-eyed, dangerous “maniacs.” Thus in August 2002, the National Depression and Manic Depression Association (NDMDA) officially changed its name to the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA). On their website, they explained that they wanted to align their terminology with that of the DSM , and to create a name that was easier to remember. But their most important reason, they admitted, was that “many people are frightened by the term ‘manic-depression’ and this keeps them from contacting us for help.” THE HUNT FOR MOOD GENES While manic-depression was slowly morphing into bipolar disorder, the search for its genetic basis continued. This story begins in the 1960s when a sociology graduate student, Janice Egeland, formed an unlikely friendship with a community of Old Order Amish in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The Old Order Amish are an extremely private religious community that eschews most contact with outsiders (“the English”). But in 1962 one family allowed Egeland to move in with them. Her plan was to do a Ph.D. dissertation on their health beliefs and behaviors. Egeland soon became vaguely aware that one of the women in her host family suffered from manic-depression, even though at the time she knew little about the disorder. As she told an interviewer three decades later: One morning, I saw this woman doubled up in pain, moaning and sobbing. When I asked her what was wrong, she responded, “I don’t have a physical pain. It’s the pain of the thoughts I’m having that is doing this to me.” At a picnic soon afterward, a grandmother explained to Egeland that they were all very familiar with the disorder she had witnessed, since it ran in the family—or as she actually put it, siss im blut (“it’s in the blood”). That remark “made such an impact on me,” Egeland later recalled, “that I shifted gears right there—that was about thirty years ago—and said, ‘That’s it. My life’s work will be with this condition.’ ” Egeland now looked for collaborators who might be interested in joining her in a study of the heritability of manic-depression among the Amish. Her first connection was to the physician Abram Hostetter, who had been raised in a Mennonite family on a farm in southeastern Pennsylvania. More collaborators joined them, eventually coming from eight schools of medicine in the United States and Canada. In 1976 “The Amish Study” was launched with grant support from the NIMH. Despite the Amish’s well-known commitment to privacy and aversion to engagement with modern technologies, the study subjects seem mostly to have cooperated willingly with the protocols: they gave blood for DNA samples and allowed probes into their family medical backgrounds. Talking to a journalist many years later, one of them explained why: “This disease has torn our family apart. I was 17 when my mother came to me and spoke of not being able to face the day—I didn’t know what she was talking about. At the time none of us knew anything of the illness, but Janice has changed that.” Egeland and her collaborators soon realized, however, that studying manic-depression among the Amish was likely to do more than produce information that would be helpful to this community. The community itself had the potential to function (in Egeland’s words) as “an ideal type of human laboratory for behavioral and medical genetic studies.” This was so for a number of reasons: the Amish rarely married outside their community; they tended to have very large families; and they kept extensive genealogical records. In fact, members of the Amish community with whom Egeland worked could trace their ancestry back to a group of thirty-two immigrants who came to Pennsylvania in the 1750s from a province in what is today Germany. Moreover, the Amish lived according to traditions that had changed little over the generations. This meant, as the researchers saw it, that any changes in disease patterns over time were unlikely to be caused by social change but could be assumed to be genetic in nature. Finally, the task generally of identifying people with manic-depression among the Amish was made much easier, it was felt, by the fact that the Amish lived according to values of simplicity, humility, and personal modesty. Any members who deviated markedly from those virtues—for example, because they were in the throes of a manic attack—would (in the words of a later newspaper article) “stand out like sore thumbs.” And because the Amish abstained from alcohol and drug use, there was little risk that researchers’ ability to diagnose manic-depression would be obscured by behaviors associated with substance abuse. By 1983, the team had identified 112 cases of manic-depression within the Amish community, out of a population of 12,500 based in fifty Amish church districts. Many of these cases were concentrated in a clan of 236 individuals who spanned four generations. Some 71 percent of these individuals had experienced either major depression or manic-depression. The inheritance pattern suggested that the disorder was inherited as a dominant gene but with incomplete penetration. For an individual to inherit the gene, only one of that individual’s parents needed to have carried it, and those who inherited the gene had a roughly 60 percent chance of suffering from manic-depression. By examining old family records, the team tracked the source of the illness for this clan back to a single individual who had been born in Europe in 1763. The team then made the then-novel move of collecting DNA samples from their subjects’ blood to perform what is called a linkage study. This form of gene hunting takes advantage of the fact that genes that sit close together on the same chromosome are often inherited together (because they remain linked during meiosis). In a linkage study, researchers therefore first screen DNA for the presence of a genetic marker: a segment of DNA with a known physical location on a chromosome. They then see whether that genetic marker is consistently found in the DNA of individuals suffering from an inherited disease—but absent in individuals who don’t suffer from that disease. If the researchers do find such a linkage, then there is a plausible case to be made that the unknown gene for the target disease is being inherited along with the known genetic marker and likely sits somewhere very close by to that marker. Egeland’s linkage study found that within the clan (code-named Pedigree 110), nearly 80 percent of those who had inherited a particular genetic marker near the tip of the eleventh chromosome also had manic-depressive illness or major depression. Nothing like this had ever been found for schizophrenia, for major depression, for any other mental disorder, or indeed for any other clinical disorder whatsoever. In 1987, with great fanfare, the results were published in Nature : For the first time the application of a generalized strategy for scanning the human genome has provided convincing evidence for the localization of a gene that is implicated in the etiology of a common clinical disorder. These findings have broad implications for research in human genetics and psychiatry. Psychiatric research was setting a new standard for medicine as a whole! As a neuroscientist active in 1987, Steven Mark Paul, recalled many years later, “For a year or two, it was probably the most exciting and interesting finding in psychiatry.” Newspapers across the country heralded it as “one of the most profound discoveries” and “the strongest evidence yet” that serious mental illness had a genetic basis. Unfortunately, within a year, new evidence had cast serious doubt on the linkage claims. Two people from the original group who had shown no previous signs of mental disorder and who shared the genetic pattern of those who did not have the illness began to develop manic-depressive symptoms. Then, when researchers looked for a similar linkage pattern on chromosome eleven in non -Amish patients with manic-depression, they found none. Egeland and her collaborators co-authored a second paper in Nature in 1989, bravely reporting this failure to confirm. Disappointment at the failure to nail down the specific gene or genes involved in manic-depression lingered for years. In 2001 the psychiatrist David Dunner admitted to the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology: I am disappointed that we have never identified the “bipolar gene.” ... I realize now how complicated it is and how naïve we were. Very good people are now looking for the genes, not a single gene. I am not going to be the one to find them, but it would be nice to know that there really are genes when patients ask, “Is this a genetic disorder?” and [right now] I can only say, “Well, we think so.” A GLAMOR DILEMMA For decades, it had been appreciated that many manic-depressives were extremely gifted and intelligent people, at least when they were not ill. Before the 1970s, however, no one had gone so far as to suggest that whatever (possibly inherited) biological quirk was responsible for the illness might play a role in facilitating their intellectual and/or artistic gifts. This first began to change during the public campaign to promote lithium as a mood stabilizer. In his 1975 book Moodswing , Ronald Fieve had celebrated not only the birth of a biological revolution in psychiatry but also the creative, impossible, maddening, and brilliant patients who were, in his view, on the front lines of that revolution. “People who suffer from... [manic-depression]... in its milder forms of mood swing tend to be magnificent performers, magnetic personalities, and true achievers. Many forms of manic elation seem to be a genetic endowment of the same order as perfect pitch, a photographic memory, great intelligence, or artistic talent of any sort.” Many “super achievers in business, the arts, and especially in politics,” owed a debt to a “superior energy” that, Fieve said, was “specifically biochemical and hereditary.” Yes, he conceded— perhaps in a nod to the older Freudian judgment of these patients— super achievers such as these were “manipulators par excellence,” but they were “also the people who get things done. Without them society would be much impoverished.” These were, of course, mere clinical impressions. Was there any independent evidence linking to “super achievement”? Over the course of the 1970s and ’80s, a series of attempts were made to answer this question. In 1974 a medical resident named Nancy Andreasen (who ten years later would help announce the 1980s biological revolution with her book The Broken Brain ) was interested in the relationship between creativity and familial mental illness. She studied a large sample of writers and found that as many as 80 percent had experienced at least one episode of major depression, mania, or hypomania, whereas only 30 percent of a control group of “noncreative” people had. Relatives of writers also had a higher incidence than expected of mood disorder. “The data support Aristotle’s dictum,” she concluded, “that... there is an association between genius and psychiatric disorder.” In 1987 Andreasen returned to her original pool of writers and controls and made an even stronger claim: thirteen years later no fewer than 43 percent of them had received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, compared to only 10 percent of the control group and 1 percent of the general population. It seemed that it was not quite right to say that there was an association between genius and mental illness in general. The association seemed to be primarily limited to bipolar forms of mood disorder. Two years later the clinical psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison published an article that made even more ripples. “Mood Disorders and Patterns of Creativity in British Writers and Artists” analyzed forty-seven British authors and visual artists who were members of the British Royal Academy and found that 38 percent had been treated for a mood disorder, particularly the bipolar variety. Jamison concluded by suggesting that the remarkable and apparently inherited connection between creativity and bipolar disorder raised important ethical issues. “Genetic research,” she wrote, “is progressing to the stage where ethical issues will, in due course, arise about amniocentesis and early identification and treatment of individuals at high risk for affective, especially bipolar, illness.” Would parents be encouraged to abort fetuses at risk for bipolar disorder—but also perhaps with the potential to be unusually creative? If so, at what cost to society? In 1993 Jamison pushed this point further in her widely noted book Touched with Fire . By this time, she had been appointed a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and had co-authored, with Frederick Goodwin, an authoritative textbook on manic-depression (see page 239). Touched with Fire celebrated the brilliant contributions made by many people born with this disorder, even as it asked readers to appreciate the enormous burden of suffering under which they labored. Jamison’s interest in the positive side of manic-depression turned out to have roots in personal experience. Two years after Touched with Fire , in her memoir An Unquiet Mind , she announced that she herself suffered from the disorder and described her own experiences with it. She focused especially on her struggles to reconcile herself to the price of submitting to effective treatment. Lithium was a lifesaving drug, she knew, but it also damped her down, made her less creative, less interesting, and less productive. “When I am my present ‘normal self,’ ” she mused wistfully, “I am far removed from when I have been my liveliest, most productive, most intense, most outgoing and effervescent. In short, for myself, I am a hard act to follow.” An Unquiet Mind made Jamison a celebrity and a role model, even as others worried that it painted a glamorous picture of a deadly serious mental illness. Edwin Fuller Torrey, a prominent schizophrenia researcher (see Chapter 5), told the Washington Post in 1995, “I think there’s a real danger in what Kay does. The danger is the romanticizing of serious mental illness.... Our tendency is to romanticize Sylvia Plath or someone like that without asking whether, if they hadn’t had the disease, they wouldn’t have produced better things over time.” All the same, by the 1990s, the public had absorbed the new message: if you had to suffer from a serious mental illness in the age of biological psychiatry, manic-depression was the one to have. In the early 1990s, Robert Boorstin, a journalist and aide to President Bill Clinton, was hospitalized for manic-depression. He arranged to have a sign put over his bed that read simply: “Thank God I’m not schizophrenic.” THE BIPOLAR SPECTRUM This destigmatizing of manic-depression coincided with—if it did not necessarily directly create—a steady broadening of the criteria for being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. By the late 1990s, many more people than before were being diagnosed with the disorder, especially newly established milder variants. In 1980 DSM-III had laid down quite strict criteria for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. It drew a clear line between bipolar disorder and major depression. It advised clinicians not to make diagnoses of bipolar disorder unless the patient showed evidence of psychotic behavior, including symptoms of full-blown mania. It told clinicians they might sometimes see patients with milder cycles of “mood disturbance” with no psychotic features; they should diagnose such patients not with bipolar disorder but with “cyclothymic disorder.” Some researchers, the authors of this section of the book conceded, thought cyclothymic disorder was on a continuum with bipolar, but they took the view that there was not yet adequate consensus that this was the case. In the years following the 1980 publication of DSM-III , however, some of these researchers started to win their argument. One of these was David Dunner from the NIMH, who had been arguing since the early 1970s for expanding the category of bipolar disorder to include patients who suffered from depression and mild mania but not severely enough to require hospitalization. “It turned out,” he told a later interviewer, “that those patients had a very high suicide attempt and suicide rate.” Another was the Armenian-American psychiatrist Hagop Akiskal, director of one of the country’s first specialized mood disorder clinics, based in Memphis, Tennessee, and who had also been arguing since the mid-1970s for seeing “cyclothymia” as a mild form of bipolar disorder. Fourteen years later, in 1994, the fourth revision of the DSM told clinicians that psychiatry now believed there were two kinds of bipolar disorder. Bipolar I was the classical, psychotic form of bipolar, and Bipolar II was a milder form in which episodes of depression alternated with experiences of either elevated mood or anger and irritability (positive or negative hypomania). But if bipolar disorder could have two subtypes, then why not more—maybe even a lot more? Akiskal soon proposed that, beyond Bipolar I and II, there were also Bipolar III and IV (and possibly still more intermediate versions between these four). More generally, his point was that bipolar disorder was best seen, not as a narrowly defined category, but as a fluid “spectrum” of disorders. A spectrum approach to bipolar, he said, was actually consistent with Emil Kraepelin’s original expansive vision of manic-depressive insanity—even though the authors of DSM-III had abandoned it (while, ironically enough, allowing themselves to be called “neo-Kraepelinians). “I have no use for the DSM,” Akiskal cheerfully told a blogger who came to interview him in 2011. Meanwhile 1990 saw the publication of a monumental textbook, Manic-Depressive Illness , jointly authored by Frederick Goodwin and Kay Redfield Jamison and widely acclaimed as a definitive synthesis of the literature. In the course of their decade-long study of the literature, the authors had become convinced of something else: that DSM-III ’s sharp boundary between bipolar disorder and depression (what some called unipolar disorder) just didn’t hold up. “We became more and more convinced that isolating bipolar illness from other major depressive disorders prejudges the relationships between bipolar and unipolar illness and diminishes appreciation of the fundamental importance of recurrence.” A bit like Akiskal, they insisted that, in rejecting sharp and categorical distinctions between bipolarity and depression, they were returning to the original vision of that master diagnostician Emil Kraepelin. A lot was a stake. If bipolar disorder was actually a spectrum of disorders—and if that spectrum encompassed some kinds of depression—then a lot of patients might require a different sort of medication than they had been getting. And some who might have struggled their whole lives without realizing they suffered from bipolar disorder might finally get the medication they needed. A disorder that was once assumed to affect only about 1 percent of the population might now (according to some calculations) affect as much as 6 percent. And all these sufferers needed help. Something else may have been at stake, at least for some players in these discussions: profits. As a number of critics soon pointed out, the push to expand the category of bipolar disorder happened during exactly the same years when the pharmaceutical industry finally found a way to make significant money from medications targeting it. Lithium had never been profitable, but in 1995 the pharmaceutical company Abbott gained FDA approval to market the proprietary drug Depakote for symptoms of mania. Depakote was not a new drug; Abbott had been selling it since the 1960s to stabilize epileptic convulsions. However, the company had then run some trials that suggested it might also be effective in “stabilizing moods”—they called it a “mood stabilizer.” It was a breakthrough moment for the industry, and other “mood stabilizing” drugs followed in short order. (They in turn would then be partly supplanted by so-called atypical antipsychotics; see Chapter 8.) Were the drug companies simply meeting an unmet need that clinicians had identified, or were they—as the psychopharmacologist David Healy, among others, insisted— cynically working behind the scenes to push the agendas of researchers whose clinical understanding of bipolar disorder aligned with their own financial interests? The question took on added ethical urgency when children emerged as the fastest-growing group of newly recognized bipolar patients. Before the 1990s, it had been very rare for children and adolescents to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Between 1994 and 2003, however, the number increased a remarkable forty -fold, from about 20,000 to about 800,000 cases per year. Some said this happened because the bipolarity of children had not previously been recognized. Bipolar children did not “cycle” the way that adults did. Instead, they were chronically irritable, hyperactive, angry (or sad), and prone to bouts of explosive rage. For this reason, they had previously been seen just as problem kids, or had been (inaccurately) diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder (ADHD). Realizing that many of these children actually had juvenile bipolar disorder, the argument now went, absolved their families of guilt and offered the children new pharmaceutical options. The argument for the existence of a hitherto unrecognized form of bipolar disorder in children (some as young as two or three) was given huge visibility by the publication in 1999 of The Bipolar Child , authored by a husband-and-wife team (Demitri Papolos was a psychiatrist at Albert Einstein University, Janice Papolos an author and family advocate). The reassuring book they co-authored was designed to help parents identify the telltale signs of juvenile bipolar disorder in their own troubled kids, and get them the help they needed. While the book talked about ways to support such children in schools and at home, it foregrounded the importance of getting them on a course of “mood stabilizing” medication. And thousands of distraught parents welcomed its advice with open arms, especially after The Bipolar Child was featured on television shows like Oprah and 20/20 . The testimonies of some of the parents in question, left on the review page of the online bookseller Amazon, are moving: I ordered this book. I got just a few pages in before I started to cry, because for the first time, I knew that I wasn’t the only one going through this. I wasn’t imagining it or making it out to be worse than it was as many people have told us. The pain and despair were real, but critics like Healy argued that profligate use of this new diagnostic category was having the effect of putting countless young children on powerful medications (mood stabilizers and antipsychotics) that had not been tested and approved for them. These medications might reduce the irritability and outbursts seen in such children, but they also often caused serious side effects (especially significant weight gain, with the risk of diabetes and heart problems later in life). The matter got sufficiently controversial that in 2013, the APA intervened by introducing a new—but inevitably also controversial —diagnostic category into the fifth revision of the DSM . “Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)” was intended to provide clinicians with an alternative diagnosis to juvenile bipolar disorder. It was classified as a form of depression rather than bipolar disorder. The problem was, no one knew if DMDD was a real disease, with its own biology. Perhaps it was just a new way of talking about the same highly disruptive behaviors that had previously led to so many diagnoses of juvenile bipolar disorder. Nevertheless, the once solid-seeming boundaries around bipolar disorder were now so soft that something, it seemed, had to be done.'}"
