When a section is selected, provide one single summary of the whole section and its subsection
Basically, provide one single summary for each selected section of a given level.

STEP 1:
For each selected section, extract their text and that of their subsections, with their respective texts extracted in isolation.
That means that for a given selected section, non categorized text will be parented to that section, and the text of each of its subsections will be parented to their respective subsections.

{'Selected sections 1':("text", {'Subsection 1'; })}
