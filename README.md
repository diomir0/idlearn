## What is idlearn?
Do you have a paper to memorize, to make sure you get its geist?
Or maybe you would like to summarize the chapter of a book and find a way to retain as much information as you can?
The *idlearn* could give you a hand in making your life easier.

idlearn is a free app that allows to generate concise yet detailed summaries and 
question-answer pairs from a given PDF or EPUB document. Using its graphical interface, 
feed it with the document of your choice, select the chapters or sections you want
and let it help you with your learning!

## Installation
### Tools and packages used 
The aim of the idlearn project is to enable everyone (with a decent computer) to
learn more efficiently, and above all **freely**. Faithful to the open-source 
philosophy, everything idlearn is based on is free to use and open.
Most importantly, idlearn uses the PyMuPDF package for text extraction, and structuring,
and light-weigth, locally runable and open-sourced LLM Mistral 7B-Instruct.

### What do I need to make idlearn run?
Mistral is ran via Ollama, so the latter will be installed on your computer 
during the setup. Mistral-7B-Instruct will be downloaded too, so make sure you have about 10GB available on your hard drive.
